Below is a list of some potential features to add to your Minesweeper game:

Add validation to ensure that board dimensions make sense. For example, a board should not be able to be created with more bombs than it has tiles.
Add a timer which lets players know how long it took them to win (or lose).
Add recursive flipping, when a tile is flipped that isn't touching a bomb (would have the number zero printed on it), all adjacent tiles additionally flip over.
Add a method to place flags at a tile instead of flipping that tile. If a square has a flag on it, it can't be flipped over.
